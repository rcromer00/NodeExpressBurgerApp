# Eat-da-Burger App

This homework assignment was created using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and an ORM. 
The app is meant to dynamically display new information entered by the user as well as inserting the new data into the MySQL database.

## How it Works

Eat-da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users insert the names of the burgers they'd like to eat. 
When the user inserts the new burger the app will dynamically display the new burger with an option to devour with a click of a button. When the user clicks the button, the burger
will move to the "Devoured Burger List". The app will then store every burger in the database, whether devoured or not.
